<p>Focusing on the quality of your food choices rather than simply restricting the quantity. By making wise and healthy food selections, it is possible to maintain a balanced diet without feeling deprived or hungry. A proper diet and nutrition is the key to live a healthy life. They say, you are what you eat. "Eat junk, you become junk. Eat healthy, you become healthy".</p>

<p>Eating well to live well‚Äù means choosing nutrient rich foods- foods that provide more nutrition (vitamins, minerals, fiber) than calories per bite. Consuming fruits and vegetables is just one way to get more nutrient rich foods in your diet. Depending on the time of year, fresh produce may not be the most cost effective so select canned or frozen vegetables that provide the most nutrition per bite.</p>
